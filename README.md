## :star: Introduction

Welcome to Telus Build-Your-Own+, an innovative project developed by our six-member team during a dynamic 24-hour hackathon in partnership with Telus. Our solution addresses the growing challenge of streaming service option paralysis by empowering users to curate a personalized TV package featuring all their preferred channels.

## :thinking: Problem Space

- **Overwhelming variety of streaming services**: Consumers face an increasing number of streaming platforms and content options, making it hard to decide where and how to access their favorite media.

- **Option paralysis**: Too many choices can lead to decision fatigue, causing frustration for users who struggle to manage multiple subscriptions and platforms.

- **Fragmentation in the streaming ecosystem**: As streaming providers compete for exclusive content, consumers are left juggling between various services to access the shows they love.

- **Lack of user-friendly solutions**: Current offerings do not provide an easy way for users to combine all their preferred channels or content into a single, streamlined package.

- **Consumer demand for personalization**: Users want more control over their media experience, preferring to curate a personalized TV package that suits their individual viewing preferences.

- **Industry challenge**: Service providers are exploring how to package their offerings to better suit user needs, but there is a gap in creating a seamless and efficient approach to media consumption.

## :telescope: Research Highlights
